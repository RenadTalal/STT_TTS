# **Task- 4  STT & TTS**

Using python to convert speech to text and text to speech with Watson services



**STT**

I used the Watson-streaming-stt with Watson service "Speech to text", and make the authentication by the API and region. 
Then install the requirements to make it run. 
the speech is saved as a .txt



**TTS**

By install the dependencies "ibm_watson" and then used some libraries from the ibm_watson. 
Then made the authentication by the API and URL, at the end I set up the service to make it apply to read the text.
the speech is saved as .mp3
